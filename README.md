Backup Branches: We've created backup branches for each week of development. These branches capture the state of the project at the end of each week, serving as checkpoints in case you need to revisit a specific point in time during the course. Feel free to explore these branches for historical context or to understand the evolution of the project.

Usage Guidance: While this project is here to assist you in your learning journey, we advise against directly copying code from this repository.
